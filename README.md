Hello!!
This is my twist on the classic Space Invaders Game!
I used PyOpenGL and GLFW so please make sure you have these libraries install!
How to play:
  Use A and D to move your Kuromi spaceship from left to right
  Use SPACE to make your Kuromi spaceship shoot 
  When you've lost or quit the game the terminal will show you what level you were on

Enjoy Kuromi Against The Invaders!!
